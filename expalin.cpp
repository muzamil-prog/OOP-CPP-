// // ChatGPT said:

// In simple words, a static data member in OOP is a variable that belongs to the class itself, not to any one object.

// So:

// All objects of that class share the same variable.

// It keeps one common value for all objects.

// You can use it without creating an object (using the class name).

// 🧩 Example idea:
// If you have a class Student, and you want to keep track of how many students were created — that number should be the same for all students.
// // So, you make it a static data member



// static variable ik esa varible ha jo class sy  jur jata ha

// static variable ik esa variable ha jasy sb objects share krty hian
